This article will deeply analyze the technological paths and investment logic behind carbon neutrality and seek the “Davis Double - click” in the green economy.</p><span id=more></span><h1>I. Technological Paths to Carbon Neutrality: From Zero - carbon to Negative - carbon</h1><h2 id=1-1-The-Three-Pillars-of-Zero-carbon-Technologies>1.1 The Three Pillars of Zero - carbon Technologies</h2><p>The core of carbon neutrality lies in reducing carbon emissions, and zero - carbon technologies are the key to achieving this goal. Zero - carbon technologies mainly include the following three pillars:<ol><li class=lvl-3><p><strong>Clean Energy</strong>: The large - scale application of renewable energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy, and hydropower. Take solar energy as an example. It has the characteristics of wide distribution and inexhaustibility. In recent years, with the continuous progress of photovoltaic technology, the efficiency of solar power generation has been gradually improved. Wind energy is divided into onshore wind power and offshore wind power. Offshore wind power has developed rapidly in recent years due to its advantages such as stable wind speed and no occupation of land area. Hydropower is a relatively mature clean energy source. Large - scale hydropower stations such as the Three Gorges Hydropower Station have a huge installed capacity and provide a large amount of stable clean electricity for the power grid.<li class=lvl-3><p><strong>Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction</strong>: Reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions through technological transformation, equipment renewal, and management optimization. For example, in the industrial field, many enterprises adopt advanced waste heat recovery technology to convert the waste heat generated in the production process into available energy and improve energy utilization efficiency. In the construction field, the promotion of energy - saving doors and windows, high - efficiency insulation materials, etc. can reduce building energy consumption. In the transportation field, the development of new energy vehicles can significantly reduce exhaust emissions compared with traditional fuel vehicles.<li class=lvl-3><p><strong>Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)</strong>: Capture and store the carbon dioxide generated in the industrial production process to prevent it from being emitted into the atmosphere. This technology mainly includes three links: carbon dioxide capture, transportation, and storage. In the capture link, there are various technologies such as pre - combustion capture, post - combustion capture, and oxy - fuel combustion available for selection according to different industrial scenarios. In terms of transportation, the captured carbon dioxide can be transported to suitable storage sites, such as depleted oil and gas fields and deep saline aquifers, through pipelines, ships, etc.</ol><p>To present the relevant information of the three pillars of zero - carbon technologies more intuitively, the following is a comparison table:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Pillars of Zero - carbon Technologies<th style=text-align:center>Typical Representatives<th style=text-align:center>Advantages<th style=text-align:center>Challenges<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Clean Energy<td style=text-align:center>Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Hydropower<td style=text-align:center>Renewable, Clean and Pollution - free<td style=text-align:center>Relatively low energy density, greatly affected by natural conditions<tr><td style=text-align:center>Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction<td style=text-align:center>Waste Heat Recovery, Energy - saving Doors and Windows<td style=text-align:center>Reduce energy consumption and emissions<td style=text-align:center>High upfront transformation investment<tr><td style=text-align:center>Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)<td style=text-align:center>Post - combustion Capture Technology<td style=text-align:center>Reduce carbon emissions from the source<td style=text-align:center>High cost, and the technological maturity needs to be improved</table><p><strong>Typical Case: The Rise of China’s Photovoltaic Industry</strong><p>Through technological innovation and large - scale production, China’s photovoltaic industry has reduced the cost of photovoltaic power generation from 2 yuan per kWh in 2010 to 0.2 yuan per kWh in 2025, becoming the world’s largest photovoltaic market. In 2024, China’s installed photovoltaic capacity exceeded 500 GW, accounting for more than 40% of the global total installed capacity. The development of China’s photovoltaic industry benefits from policy support, R & D investment, and a complete industrial chain. Many enterprises have continuously increased R & D in photovoltaic cell technology, module manufacturing processes, etc., improved product conversion efficiency and quality, and at the same time, large - scale production has effectively reduced costs, making Chinese photovoltaic products highly competitive in the global market.<p><img alt=Image src=CGC1.png><h2 id=1-2-The-Future-Potential-of-Negative-carbon-Technologies>1.2 The Future Potential of Negative - carbon Technologies</h2><p>Negative - carbon technologies refer to the absorption of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through means such as afforestation and ocean carbon sequestration. For example:<ul class=lvl-0><li class=lvl-2><p><strong>Forest Carbon Sinks</strong>: Through large - scale afforestation, China absorbs about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Forests are like huge “carbon reservoirs”. Trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and fix it in wood, soil, and vegetation. With the increase in forest area and the improvement of forest quality, their carbon sequestration capacity will be further enhanced.<li class=lvl-2><p><strong>Ocean Carbon Sinks</strong>: Increase the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide through technologies such as ocean fertilization and seaweed cultivation. The ocean covers most of the earth’s surface and has huge carbon sequestration potential. Ocean fertilization is to add specific nutrients to the ocean to promote the growth of phytoplankton, thereby increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. Seaweed cultivation can not only absorb carbon dioxide but also has high economic value and can be used in many fields such as food and medicine.</ul><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Negative - carbon Technologies<th style=text-align:center>Implementation Status<th style=text-align:center>Potential Risks<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Forest Carbon Sinks<td style=text-align:center>Large - scale afforestation is continuously advancing<td style=text-align:center>Forest fires, pests and diseases, etc. affect the stability of carbon sinks<tr><td style=text-align:center>Ocean Carbon Sinks<td style=text-align:center>Some technologies are in the experimental and small - scale application stages<td style=text-align:center>May cause unknown impacts on the marine ecosystem</table><h1>II. Green Finance: The Capital Engine of Carbon Neutrality</h1><h2 id=2-1-The-Definition-and-Role-of-Green-Finance>2.1 The Definition and Role of Green Finance</h2><p>Green finance refers to the financial services provided to support economic activities that improve the environment, address climate change, and enable efficient use of resources. It promotes the realization of the carbon neutrality goal by guiding social capital to flow into green fields. Green finance plays a crucial role in the process of carbon neutrality. On the one hand, it provides the necessary financial support for green projects, enabling many projects that were difficult to carry out due to lack of funds to be implemented. On the other hand, through market mechanisms, it prompts the transfer of funds from high - pollution and high - energy - consuming fields to green and low - carbon fields, optimizes resource allocation, and promotes the green transformation of the economic structure.<p><strong>Data Support: The Scale and Growth of Green Finance</strong><p>According to data from the People’s Bank of China, in 2024, the balance of green loans in China reached 20 trillion yuan, and the issuance scale of green bonds exceeded 5 trillion yuan, both ranking among the top in the world. The following is a table showing the growth of the scale of green finance in China:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Year<th style=text-align:center>Balance of Green Loans (trillion yuan)<th style=text-align:center>Issuance Scale of Green Bonds (trillion yuan)<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>2020<td style=text-align:center>11.95<td style=text-align:center>1.26<tr><td style=text-align:center>2021<td style=text-align:center>15.9<td style=text-align:center>1.6<tr><td style=text-align:center>2022<td style=text-align:center>18.5<td style=text-align:center>2.7<tr><td style=text-align:center>2023<td style=text-align:center>19.5<td style=text-align:center>4.1<tr><td style=text-align:center>2024<td style=text-align:center>20<td style=text-align:center>5</table><p>It can be clearly seen from the table that in recent years, the balance of green loans and the issuance scale of green bonds in China have shown a steady growth trend, reflecting the continuous expansion of the green finance market.<h2 id=2-2-Innovative-Products-of-Green-Finance>2.2 Innovative Products of Green Finance</h2><ol><li class=lvl-3><p><strong>Green Credit</strong>: Provide low - interest loans for clean energy projects to reduce the financing costs of enterprises. Financial institutions such as banks offer preferential loan interest rates to enterprises based on the green attributes and risk assessment of projects. For example, for large - scale wind power projects, green credit can provide long - term and low - interest capital support, helping enterprises reduce repayment pressure and improve the feasibility and profitability of projects.<li class=lvl-3><p><strong>Green Bonds</strong>: Raise long - term and stable funds for green infrastructure projects. The issuers of green bonds can be governments, enterprises, etc. The raised funds are specially used for green projects, such as urban rail transit construction and sewage treatment facility upgrades. Green bonds have clear environmental benefit goals. Investors can contribute to environmental protection while obtaining economic returns.<li class=lvl-3><p><strong>Green Funds</strong>: Invest in low - carbon technologies, renewable energy, and other fields to share the dividends of the green economy. Green funds pool social funds and invest in green enterprises and projects with growth potential, promoting the R & D and industrial application of related technologies. For example, some enterprises focusing on the R & D of new energy vehicle battery technology may receive investment support from green funds.</ol><p>The following is a comparison table of innovative products of green finance:<table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Green Finance Products<th style=text-align:center>Characteristics<th style=text-align:center>Main Application Fields<th style=text-align:center>Role in Carbon Neutrality<tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Green Credit<td style=text-align:center>Low - interest, long - term<td style=text-align:center>Clean energy projects<td style=text-align:center>Reduce enterprise financing costs and promote project implementation<tr><td style=text-align:center>Green Bonds<td style=text-align:center>Raised funds are specially used for green projects<td style=text-align:center>Green infrastructure construction<td style=text-align:center>Provide long - term and stable funds for large - scale green projects<tr><td style=text-align:center>Green Funds<td style=text-align:center>Invest in enterprises and projects in green fields<td style=text-align:center>R & D of low - carbon technologies, renewable energy<td style=text-align:center>Promote green technology innovation and industrialization</table><p><strong>Typical Case: The Green Finance Practice of CICC</strong><p>CICC has raised funds for a number of photovoltaic and wind power projects through the issuance of green bonds, with a cumulative investment scale of more than 10 billion yuan, promoting the rapid development of clean energy. CICC actively explores in the field of green finance. With its professional financial service capabilities and market influence, it accurately connects the financing needs of clean energy projects.
