    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the face of the severe challenge of global climate change, <strong>carbon neutrality has become the core strategy for the economic development of various countries</strong>. From the breakthroughs in zero - carbon technologies to the innovation of green finance, carbon neutrality is not only a technological revolution but also an “alchemy” of value transition. This article will deeply analyze the technological paths and investment logic behind carbon neutrality and seek the “Davis Double - click” in the green economy.<br> <span id="more"></span></p>
<h1 id="I-Technological-Paths-to-Carbon-Neutrality-From-Zero-carbon-to-Negative-carbon"><a href="#I-Technological-Paths-to-Carbon-Neutrality-From-Zero-carbon-to-Negative-carbon" class="headerlink" title="I. Technological Paths to Carbon Neutrality: From Zero - carbon to Negative - carbon"></a>I. Technological Paths to Carbon Neutrality: From Zero - carbon to Negative - carbon</h1><h2 id="1-1-The-Three-Pillars-of-Zero-carbon-Technologies"><a href="#1-1-The-Three-Pillars-of-Zero-carbon-Technologies" class="headerlink" title="1.1 The Three Pillars of Zero - carbon Technologies"></a>1.1 The Three Pillars of Zero - carbon Technologies</h2><p>The core of carbon neutrality lies in reducing carbon emissions, and zero - carbon technologies are the key to achieving this goal. Zero - carbon technologies mainly include the following three pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clean Energy</strong>: The large - scale application of renewable energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy, and hydropower. Take solar energy as an example. It has the characteristics of wide distribution and inexhaustibility. In recent years, with the continuous progress of photovoltaic technology, the efficiency of solar power generation has been gradually improved. Wind energy is divided into onshore wind power and offshore wind power. Offshore wind power has developed rapidly in recent years due to its advantages such as stable wind speed and no occupation of land area. Hydropower is a relatively mature clean energy source. Large - scale hydropower stations such as the Three Gorges Hydropower Station have a huge installed capacity and provide a large amount of stable clean electricity for the power grid.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction</strong>: Reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions through technological transformation, equipment renewal, and management optimization. For example, in the industrial field, many enterprises adopt advanced waste heat recovery technology to convert the waste heat generated in the production process into available energy and improve energy utilization efficiency. In the construction field, the promotion of energy - saving doors and windows, high - efficiency insulation materials, etc. can reduce building energy consumption. In the transportation field, the development of new energy vehicles can significantly reduce exhaust emissions compared with traditional fuel vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)</strong>: Capture and store the carbon dioxide generated in the industrial production process to prevent it from being emitted into the atmosphere. This technology mainly includes three links: carbon dioxide capture, transportation, and storage. In the capture link, there are various technologies such as pre - combustion capture, post - combustion capture, and oxy - fuel combustion available for selection according to different industrial scenarios. In terms of transportation, the captured carbon dioxide can be transported to suitable storage sites, such as depleted oil and gas fields and deep saline aquifers, through pipelines, ships, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>To present the relevant information of the three pillars of zero - carbon technologies more intuitively, the following is a comparison table:</p>

<p><strong>Typical Case: The Rise of China’s Photovoltaic Industry</strong></p>
<p>Through technological innovation and large - scale production, China’s photovoltaic industry has reduced the cost of photovoltaic power generation from 2 yuan per kWh in 2010 to 0.2 yuan per kWh in 2025, becoming the world’s largest photovoltaic market. In 2024, China’s installed photovoltaic capacity exceeded 500 GW, accounting for more than 40% of the global total installed capacity. The development of China’s photovoltaic industry benefits from policy support, R &amp; D investment, and a complete industrial chain. Many enterprises have continuously increased R &amp; D in photovoltaic cell technology, module manufacturing processes, etc., improved product conversion efficiency and quality, and at the same time, large - scale production has effectively reduced costs, making Chinese photovoltaic products highly competitive in the global market.</p>

For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forest Carbon Sinks</strong>: Through large - scale afforestation, China absorbs about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Forests are like huge “carbon reservoirs”. Trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and fix it in wood, soil, and vegetation. With the increase in forest area and the improvement of forest quality, their carbon sequestration capacity will be further enhanced.</li>
<li><strong>Ocean Carbon Sinks</strong>: Increase the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide through technologies such as ocean fertilization and seaweed cultivation. The ocean covers most of the earth’s surface and has huge carbon sequestration potential. Ocean fertilization is to add specific nutrients to the ocean to promote the growth of phytoplankton, thereby increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. Seaweed cultivation can not only absorb carbon dioxide but also has high economic value and can be used in many fields such as food and medicine.</li>

    <title>The &quot;Occam&#39;s Razor&quot; in the Low - altitude Economy:How to Eliminate Pseudo - demands and Identify the Real Market Pain Points?</title>
    <url>/en/posts/3585213115/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the wave of the low - altitude economy, concepts such as drone logistics, air taxis, and urban air mobility (UAM) are emerging in an endless stream, seemingly presenting a prosperous scene. However, behind the hustle and bustle, many so - called “innovations” are just pseudo - demands in the guise of technology. How can we use the “Occam’s Razor” to eliminate these redundancies and find the real market pain points? Starting from critical thinking and combining data and cases, this article will reveal the essence and future of the low - altitude economy.<br> <span id="more"></span></p>

Many projects, under the banners of “future transportation” and “smart cities”, lack actual application scenarios. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aerial Advertising Drones</strong>: Although they have a cool visual effect, they are costly and have a limited audience, making it difficult to form a large - scale market.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Flying Backpacks</strong>: The technology is immature, with great safety hazards and extremely low market demand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data Source: 2024 “Global Low - altitude Economy White Paper”</p>
<p>As can be seen from the table, the actual market sizes of drone logistics and agricultural plant protection drones have relatively small gaps with the expected ones, while the gaps for air taxis and urban air mobility (UAM) are huge, indicating obvious pseudo - demands in the latter.</p>

Using the “Occam’s Razor” to Eliminate Redundancies"></a>II. Using the “Occam’s Razor” to Eliminate Redundancies</h1><h2 id="2-1-Key-Points-of-the-“Occam’s-Razor”"><a href="#2-1-Key-Points-of-the-“Occam’s-Razor”" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Key Points of the “Occam’s Razor”"></a>2.1 Key Points of the “Occam’s Razor”</h2><p>The “Occam’s Razor” principle emphasizes: “Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.” In the low - altitude economy, this means that we need to eliminate those complex but valueless concepts and focus on the simplest and most direct demands.</p>
<h2 id="2-2-Three-Criteria-for-Eliminating-Pseudo-demands-in-the-Low-altitude-Economy"><a href="#2-2-Three-Criteria-for-Eliminating-Pseudo-demands-in-the-Low-altitude-Economy" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Three Criteria for Eliminating Pseudo - demands in the Low - altitude Economy"></a>2.2 Three Criteria for Eliminating Pseudo - demands in the Low - altitude Economy</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Technical Feasibility</strong>: Is there mature technical support?</li>
<li><strong>Market Demand</strong>: Is there real and large - scale demand?</li>
<li><strong>Economy</strong>: Is the cost controllable and can commercialization be achieved?</li>
</ol>
<p>Take air taxis as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Feasibility</strong>: Currently, problems such as battery life and air traffic management have not been completely solved.</li>
<li><strong>Market Demand</strong>: High costs limit the user group, and the market demand is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Economy</strong>: The operating costs are extremely high, making it difficult to achieve profitability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, at the current stage, air taxis are more of a concept hype rather than a real demand.</p>

Future Outlook: The “Golden Decade” of the Low - altitude Economy</h1><p>The real value of the low - altitude economy lies in solving the pain points of traditional industries, rather than creating new concept bubbles. In the next decade, with technological progress and policy support, fields such as drone logistics, agricultural plant protection, and emergency rescue will experience explosive growth. And those pseudo - demands lacking actual value will eventually be eliminated by the market.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>The future of the low - altitude economy does not lie in the accumulation of concepts, but in solving real market pain points. <strong>Using the “Occam’s Razor” to eliminate pseudo - demands and focusing on implementable business models is the key to the sustainable development of the low - altitude economy.</strong> As Einstein said, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” In the exploration of the low - altitude economy, we should not only maintain respect for technology but also adhere to the pursuit of value.</p>
